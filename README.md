# Jarvis - Python Personal Assistant

Jarvis is a Python-based personal assistant that integrates speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities. 
This project showcases foundational features for a voice-driven interactive application, including voice command recognition, audio recording, and basic system control.

 # Whatâ€™s Done So Far
 
Speech Recognition: Implemented voice command recognition using the speech_recognition library.
Text-to-Speech: Enabled text responses with the pyttsx3 library for a conversational interface.
Audio Recording: Developed functionality to record and save voice commands as .wav files using sounddevice and soundfile.
Wikipedia Integration: Added capability to search and summarize Wikipedia articles based on user queries.
System Commands: Implemented basic system control features, such as opening Notepad on Windows.

# Features

Voice Command Recognition: Convert spoken commands into text and execute actions.
Text-to-Speech: Convert text responses into spoken words.
Audio Recording: Record audio commands and save them for processing.
Wikipedia Search: Retrieve and summarize information from Wikipedia.
System Control: Perform system tasks like opening Notepad.
